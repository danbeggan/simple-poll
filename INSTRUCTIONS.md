Your task is to create a simple voting rails app. The main features should be user registration and login, poll creation and link generation for the poll, which other users/friends can use to access and vote. The poll has a title and as many options as the user makes. Please add vote restrictions - 2 vote per ip and 1 vote per session.

Pages:

Login (index), Registration (first and last name, email, password), Poll CRUD, Poll voting/show for voters.

For the task please use:

- Rails 4.2

- MySQL or Postgresql your choice

- Bootstrap or Foundation

- Use HAML

- Write some tests using rspec and some integration tests with capybara and cucumber. Full test coverage is not needed just write something to show knowledge.

- Create a repo in Github or bitbucket and push your progress there and share the link with us.

Bonus:

- Make the Poll show page realtime when voting

You can use whatever gems you like, except any gem that makes everything above and makes the task senseless :)
